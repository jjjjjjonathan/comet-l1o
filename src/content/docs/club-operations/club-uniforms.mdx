:::note

Club uniform operations can only be done on the web application, and not through the mobile apps on iOS and Android.

:::

## Find your club page

To go to your club's main page, click on the **Clubs** tab in the left sidebar, and click on **My Club**.

## Adding a club uniform

On your club page, click on the **Team Kits** tab below the club information. From there, click on the **Add** button to create a new uniform.

### Selecting the uniform design and colours

Select your kit type in the dropdown (home, away, other, or goalkeeper) and the pattern/colours. Click on the **Save** button when you are finished.

### Attaching a photo of the uniform (optional?)

To add a photo or rendering of your club's uniform, click on the **Picture** button in the team kits section to upload a file.

In the upload form, you can optionally add a description, and drag and drop a file into the dotted box to upload the file (you can also click on **Choose** to find the file in your filesystem).
