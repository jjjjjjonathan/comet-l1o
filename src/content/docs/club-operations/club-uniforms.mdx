In this guide, we will cover adding, editing, and deleting club uniforms.

:::note

Club uniform operations can only be done on the web application, and not through the mobile apps on iOS and Android.

:::

## Find your club page

To go to your club's main page, click on the **Clubs** tab in the left sidebar, and click on **My Club**.

## Adding and editing a club uniform

On your club page, click on the **Team Kits** tab below the club information. From there, click on the **Add** button to create a new uniform.

:::note

Make sure you are on your parent club page, and not a specific team page within the parent club.

### Selecting the uniform design and colours

Select your kit type in the dropdown (home, away, other, or goalkeeper) and the pattern/colours. Click on the **Save** button when you are finished. **Do not use the _Save As ACTIVE_ button**.

:::tip

You can add multiple versions of the same uniform with different variations. For example, you can add your home uniform twice but changing the colour of socks to have different home uniform options.

:::

Once saved, you can click on the **Edit** button and repeat the process above if you want to modify any uniforms.

### Attaching a photo of the uniform (optional?)

To add a photo or rendering of your club's uniform, click on the **Picture** button in the team kits section to upload a file.

Click on the button with a plus sign to upload a new file connected with the selected club uniform.

In the upload form, you can optionally add a description, and drag and drop a file into the dotted box to upload the file (you can also click on **Choose** to find the file in your filesystem).
