:::note

Adding people to a competition can only be done through the web application, and not the COMET Football apps on iOS and Android.

This step is only necessary for League1 BC and Alberta clubs. League1 Ontario clubs should skip this step until stated otherwise.

:::

After registering players, coaches, and team officials into your club pool, you need to add them into the respective competitions so they can be added into match-day lineups.

## Navigate to the competition

To access a list of your competitions, click on **My Competitions** from the left sidebar after clicking on the competitions module. From there, select the competition you would like to add a player or team official to your club. For example, if you wanted to add a player to your roster in the 2024 Men's League1 BC competition, select League1 BC (M) 2024.

## Navigate to your club in the competition

Once you have entered the specific competition, click on the **Clubs** tab to show a list of clubs participating in the competition. If you want to add players, click on the plus sign under the **Players** column that corresponds to your club. For coaches and team officials, click on the plus sign under the **Officials** column that corresponds to your club.

## Add people to your competition roster

A modal will pop up listing the players or team officials in your club pool. Select your player or team official using the corresponding checkbox on the right-most column. If you're selecting a player, you can also assign a shirt number under the "**#**" column. When you're finished selecting all of your players and team officials, click on **Add selected** at the bottom to finish the process.

## Submit your competition roster

Once you have added all of your players and team officials to the competition, you must change the status of your roster from **Entered** to **Submitted**.

Click on the dropdown arrow button that corresponds with your club, and select **Submitted** to change the status and submit the roster for your provincial association to approve.
