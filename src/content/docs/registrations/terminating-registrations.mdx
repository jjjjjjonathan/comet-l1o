If a former player, coach, or staff member has an active registration with your club, you can terminate their registration through COMET.

:::note

Terminating registrations can only be done on the web application, not through the mobile apps on iOS and Android.

## Finding your club members with active registrations

In the left sidebar, open the **Clubs** tab and click on **My Club** to go to your club's main page.

On your club's main page, click on the **Players** tab to show the list of players with active registrations under your club. Clicking on the **Coaches** tab will show a list of registered coaches and staff members. If you find a person whose registration you want to terminate, click on their name to go to their **Person** page.

## Terminating a registration from a person's page

On a player's or coach's person page, you can find their active registrations at the bottom, and click on **Edit** to start the termination process.

import editRegistration from '@assets/terminations/edit-registration.webp';

<Image src={editRegistration} alt='' />

Once you are in the edit page, change the **Date to** field to the date when the registration ended. If you are terminating a registration for a player, you also have to provide a reason in the dropdown menu, such as **National Transfer**, **Retired**, or **Other** among options.

When you are done, click on the **Save as...** button, and then click on **Save as TERMINATED**. A confirmation modal will pop up, asking if you're sure you want to change a status from **CONFIRMED** to **TERMINATED**. You can optionally fill out a reason in the box, and then click on **Yes** to finalize the termination.
