In this guide, we will cover searching for players within COMET, and registering both existing and new COMET players to your club as club referents.

:::note

Player registration can only be done on the web application, not through the mobile apps on iOS and Android.

## Search if a player is already in COMET

---

To maintain player history and prevent duplicates of the same player, we start by searching for the player.

### Finding the search console

---

Click on the players tab in the left sidebar to open a list of more options, and click on "Search" to open up the console on another page as highlighted in the red box of the image below.

### Using the search form

From here, you can use the form to help narrow your search for a player. While any of the fields can be used and are optional, I recommend searching by family name, first name, and/or date of birth.

:::tip

If a player has accented characters in their name, try searching with and without them when using name search.

:::

In the active registrations section under the search form, I also suggest clicking the X beside "Organisation" and "Club" to leave those fields because those would limit to your search to only within that governing body or club (for example, you would use that to only search for players with registrations in Ontario Soccer). Include the organisation and/or club only if you know the player has existed in COMET before.

Results will pop up if there are any, usually 10 players per page. You can further narrow your search results by typing in the box above each column.

If the player you're looking to register comes up in your search results, skip over to the section on [registering existing COMET players](#the-searched-player-is-already-in-comet)
