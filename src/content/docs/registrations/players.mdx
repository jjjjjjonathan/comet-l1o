In this guide, we will cover searching for players within COMET, and registering both existing and new COMET players to your club as club referents.

:::note

Player registration can only be done on the web application, not through the mobile apps on iOS and Android.

## Search if a player is already in COMET

---

To maintain player history and prevent duplicates of the same player, we start by searching for the player.

### Finding the search console

---

Click on the players tab in the left sidebar to open a list of more options, and click on "Search" to open up the console on another page as highlighted in the red box of the image below.

### Using the search form

From here, you can use the form to help narrow your search for a player. While any of the fields can be used and are optional, I recommend searching by family name, first name, and/or date of birth.

:::tip

If a player has accented characters in their name, try searching with and without them when using name search.

:::

In the active registrations section under the search form, I also suggest clicking the X beside "Organisation" and "Club" to leave those fields because those would limit to your search to only within that governing body or club (for example, you would use that to only search for players with registrations in Ontario Soccer). Include the organisation and/or club only if you know the player has existed in COMET before.

Results will pop up if there are any, usually 10 players per page. You can further narrow your search results by typing in the box above each column.

If the player you're looking to register comes up in your search results, skip over to the section on [registering existing COMET players](#the-searched-player-is-already-in-comet)

## Register a player to your club

After searching whether a player exists in COMET or not, you can move on to registering the player.

### The searched player is not in COMET

- under player tab on left sidebar, click on first registration
- form (anything in red is mandatory)
  - national id = SEOS number?
  - in family and first name enter their full names, but common name can be what they prefer to go by (the common name of "David Wayne Hoilett Jr." is "Junior Hoilett")
  - passport number is an id number required by Canada Soccer. Not everyone will have passports, so use acronyms to distinguish what kind of id it is (add DL in the front if it's a driver's licence, HC for health card, etc.)
  - position will be the player's main playing position
- active registration
  - make sure the club is correct, otherwise find it with magnifying glass
  - organisation should be provincial governing body (ontario soccer, alberta soccer, bc soccer)
  - if it's their first time in the system, keep registration type to first registration
  - date from, that should be the date from when your player is a member of your club (you can make it the current date for simplicity's sake)
- once saved, wait for approval from the league to confirm the registration

### The searched player is already in COMET
