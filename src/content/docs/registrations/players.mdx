In this guide, we will cover searching for players within COMET, and registering both existing and new COMET players to your club.

:::note

Player registration can only be done on the web application, not through the mobile apps on iOS and Android.

## Search if a player is already in COMET

---

To maintain player history and prevent duplicates of the same player, we start by searching for the player.

### Finding the search console

---

Click on the players tab in the left sidebar to open a list of more options, and click on "Search" to open up the console on another page as highlighted in the red box of the image below.

/>

### Using the search form

From here, you can use the form to help narrow your search for a player. While any of the fields can be used and are optional, I recommend searching by family name, first name, and/or date of birth.

  alt='The form to search for players within COMET. Red boxes highlight key form fields: Family Name, First Name, and Date of Birth'
/>

:::tip

If a player has accented characters in their name, try searching with and without them when using name search.

:::

In the active registrations section under the search form, I also suggest clicking the X beside "Organisation" and "Club" to leave those fields because those would limit to your search to only within that governing body or club (for example, you would use that to only search for players with registrations in Ontario Soccer). Include the organisation and/or club only if you know the player has existed in COMET before.

/>

Results will pop up if there are any, usually 10 players per page. You can further narrow your search results by typing in the box above each column.

/>

If the player you're looking to register comes up in your search results, skip over to the section on [registering existing COMET players](#the-searched-player-is-already-in-comet)

## Register a player to your club

After searching whether a player exists in COMET or not, you can move on to registering the player.

### The searched player is not in COMET

If a player isn't in COMET, you'll be registering them into the system for the first time. Click on "Player registration" under the Players tab in the left sidebar.

A form will open up where you can enter your player's information. Any form fields with red labels are mandatory, while the rest are optional.

:::tip

- For **National ID**, put the player identification ID from your governing body (for Ontario Soccer, that is their SEOS number?).
- Enter full names in the **Family** and **First Name** fields, but enter the player's preferred name under **Common Name**. For example, the common name of David Wayne Hoilett Jr. is **Junior Hoilett**.
- **Passport #** is required by Canada Soccer, but we understand that not everyone will have a passport. Use something like a driver's licence or health card, and include an acronym in front of the number (something like `DL1234567890` for a driver's licence).
- This will be the best time to include a player's headshot. Click on **Choose image** to upload a photo per your league's specifications in the manual.

:::

Before you save, you will also need to fill out the active registrations section at the bottom.

:::tip

- If your club isn't automatically in the field, use the magnifying glass button to search for your club.
- Ensure that the **organisation** is also your club's governing body (Alberta Soccer, BC Soccer, or Ontario Soccer).
- Ensure that the discipline is **football** and not anything else.
- Registration type in this case should be **First Registration**.
- Enter the current date in the **Date From** field (if this changes we will let you know).

:::

Once you have successfully saved and submitted the player, wait for approval from the league to confirm the registration. After that, you player will be available in your competitions.

### The searched player is already in COMET

:::note

We're still working on updating the documentation, and something will be here shortly!
