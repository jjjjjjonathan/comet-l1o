As a match official, you will be assigned matches where you need to accept or reject.

## Finding your list of assignments

On the homepage in [COMET's web application](https://comet.canadasoccer.com), you will immediately see a list of matches that you are assigned to in a table. The right-most column is a circle. If it is in yellow, you need to decide whether to accept or reject the assignment. Click on the yellow circle to open the modal to accept or reject the assignment.

import refAcceptMatch from '@assets/referees/ref-accept-match.webp';

## Accepting or rejecting the assignment

If you accept the assignment, simply press the `Save as confirmed` button.

If you are rejecting the assignment, put a reason in the `Reason/description` field, and press the `Save as rejected` button.

import refAssignmentDecision from '@assets/referees/ref-assignment-decision.webp';

If you rejected the assignment, the match should have disappeared from the list on your COMET homepage. If you accepted the match, the circle in the right-most column of the table should've changed from yellow to green, indicating that you are confirmed for the match.
