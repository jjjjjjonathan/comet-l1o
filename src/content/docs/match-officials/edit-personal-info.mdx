Editing your profile information can only be done through the web application, and not the COMET Football App on mobile.

import { Image } from 'astro:assets';

Once you are logged into to your COMET account linked to your referee profile, you can edit your profile information as you see fit. This is especially important if we recently created the account for you and may have used placeholder information for some of the fields.

## Finding the personal info page

In the left sidebar of [COMET's web application](https://comet.canadasoccer.com), click on the **Referees and Officials** tab, and select the **My personal info** option. This should take you to your person profile in COMET. From there, click on the **Edit** button to change your profile information.

import refPersonalInfo from '@assets/referees/ref-personal-info.webp';

/>

All the fields marked with red labels are considered mandatory by COMET and Canada Soccer. I highly suggest not inputting anything in the form fields with white labels. You may also choose to upload a photo of yourself for identification purposes.

After you have finished editing your profile, click on the **Save** button to complete the process.

import refEditProfile from '@assets/referees/ref-edit-profile.webp';
