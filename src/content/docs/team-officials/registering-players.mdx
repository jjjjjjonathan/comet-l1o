Player registration can only be done on the web application, not through the mobile apps on iOS and Android.

## Search if a player is already in COMET

To maintain player history and prevent duplicates of the same player, we start by searching for the player.

Click on the players tab in the left sidebar to open a list of more options, and click on "Search" to open up the console on another page.

From here, you can use the form to help narrow your search for a player. While any of the fields can be used and are optional, I recommend searching by family name, first name, and/or date of birth.

:::note

Keep in mind if you search by name, accents will affect your results.

:::

In the active registrations section under the search form, I also suggest clicking the X beside "Organisation" and "Club" because those would limit to your search to only within that organization or club (for example, you would use that only to search for players with registrations in Ontario Soccer).

Results will pop up if there are any, usually 10 players per page. You can further narrow your search results by typing in the box above each column.

If the player you're looking to register comes up in your search results, skip over to the section on [registering existing COMET players](#the-searched-player-is-already-in-comet)

## Register a player to your club
