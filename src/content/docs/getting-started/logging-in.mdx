If you received an email with a user login to COMET, you are now a user in the system. This is just a quick guide to get you logged in.

## Log into the web application

Visit [Canada Soccer's COMET platform](https://comet.canadasoccer.com/) to login with the username and password generated in your email.

### Change your password

Once you're in, click on your profile in the top right corner, and click on settings to take you to the section to update your password.

This will open a "User settings" modal where you can request a password update from what was automatically generated for you.

### Change the colour theme of COMET (optional)

If you'd like, you can change the colour scheme of COMET by clicking on the gear icon on the right side. It will open up a sidebar on the right side where you can select a different colour under light or dark themes.

You can also change menu modes in this sidebar. The "Overlay" mode will hide the left sidebar behind a menu button in the top left. "Static" mode will keep the main sidebar always on the page.

All screenshots for the rest of the guides will use a dark theme, but you can choose whichever theme you would like.
