## Setting a lineup in the COMET Football mobile app

Download the COMET Football app on the iOS App Store and Google Play Store for Android, and log in with your account credentials provided to you by COMET.

### Finding your match to set the lineup

After logging into the COMET Football app, you'll be greeted with the main calendar screen. Each dot on one of the days in the calendar represents a match. You can click on a day to see a list of matches for that day. Click on one of the matches to go to the specific game page.

import calendar from '@assets/match-ops/calendar.webp';

/>

Alternatively, you can also click on the ball icon at the bottom to see a list of matches. Matches under the **UPCOMING** tab are matches that haven't been finished yet, and matches under the **PREVIOUS** tab are games that have been completed. Selecting one of these matches will also take you to the specific game page.

### Viewing the match and switching to your team tab

import matchPage from '@assets/match-ops/match-page.webp';

The match page will start under the **INFO** tab where you can find details on the location and scheduled time/date of the match. Swipe to your team's tab as either **HOME** or **AWAY** to see your lineup.

### Setting your players in the match lineup

Press **Add** beside either **Starting lineup** or **Substitutes** to select players for your match lineup. You will see a list of available players.

If you have set a lineup in the last match, you can press the **Previous** button to select the same players. You will be able to make changes after so this is the quickest way to set your lineup in the middle of the season.

To select players manually, press the green button with the plus sign beside the player you want to pick. Make sure **SL** is in blue if they are in the starting lineup. If the player is a goalkeeper, **GK** has to be blue. If the player is the captain, **CP** has to be blue. Press the circle beside the player's name to add or edit their shirt number.

When finished, press the blue button with a checkmark in the bottom right to move your selected players into the match lineup. You can view your selection when you switch from the **Available** tab to the **Lineup** tab at the top of the screen. You can make any necessary edits in the lineup tab, including changes to specific player numbers, roles, and whether they're a starter or a substitute. Please note that the lineup in this state is not considered finalized or submitted as you still need to select your coaches and team officials.

### Setting your team officials in the lineup

Go back to the match page under your team tab, and press \*Add** beside **Team officials** to assign your coaches and other bench roles. Much like the player, you can use the **Previous\*\* button to select the team officials from your last match.

To select a team official manually, press the green button with a plus sign under the role you want to assign a team official to. Select from the list of names registered to your club in those roles.

import coachSelect from '@assets/match-ops/coach-select.webp';

At a minimum, you need to have at least someone assigned to the **Head coach** role. If you want to assign extra people in the listed roles, press **Add team officials** to select a role to add, and follow the same process outlined above.

### Confirming your lineup selection

After you have selected your players and team officials, go back to the match page under your team tab of **HOME** or **AWAY**, and press the **Set to CONFIRMED** button at the bottom. You do not need to enter a reason or description. Just press the checkmark to confirm your lineup selection.
